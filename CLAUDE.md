help me complete this tutorial: https://medium.com/@islam.farid16/monitoring-a-nestjs-application-with-prometheus-and-grafana-31436a495d0e. keep a log of the progress and learned lessons/tips in the Readme.md
keep used commands in the readme
if there's interactive commands explain what to input and ask me to do it myself
here's the root folder: ~/Documents/3-resources/code/github.com/gianv9/nest-grafana
nest app initialized in nest-app subfolder
npm install prom-client installed/ran successfully
i've copied the text from the tutorial into Tutorial.md
when a major task/milestone is completed ask to commit the changes to git/github
use conventional commits for commit messages
